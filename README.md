Apple calls their new design language Liquid Glass — so naturally, this theme is called Solid Glass. Get it?

Solid glass is a theme that brings the fresh iOS 26 beta 1 icons to older jailbreakable devices, but with subtle enhancements to better match older icon styles. This isn't just a straight port as I’ve optimized it to feel native on older versions, from icon corner radius to contrast levels.

# Compatibility
Solid Glass supports any jailbreakable iOS version - both rootful and rootless,
just make sure to download the right variant from the **Releases** tab, apply using SnowBoard and enjoy!
