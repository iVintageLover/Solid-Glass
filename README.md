Apple calls their new design language Liquid Glass — so naturally, I had to call this Solid Glass. Get it?

Solid glass is a theme that brings the fresh iOS 26 Liquid Glass icons to older jailbreakable devices, now with Dark Mode icon supprt! This isn't just a straight port as I’ve optimized it to feel native on older versions, from icon corner radius to contrast levels.
